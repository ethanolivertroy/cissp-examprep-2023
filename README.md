# üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª CISSP Exam Prep 2023

Preparing for the CISSP exam can be overwhelming for many candidates due to the vast amount of information to cover over 8 domains and a notoriously challenging exam format. When I started preparing for my CISSP exam, I had a clear plan in mind: to read the official study guide, take detailed & organized notes, and ensure that I understood every concept inside and out. 

However, after a few days, I realized that trying to shove as much information down my brain as possible was not going to work for the CISSP exam. I then decided to change my approach and started doing as many practice questions as possible. I took advantage of the many practice tests available online and spent several hours every day answering 100s of questions from Pocket Prep, Boson, and Cybex. 

As I answered more questions, I realized that my understanding of the material improved significantly. Doing practice questions helped me identify my weak areas, and I could focus my attention on improving those areas. It also helped me understand the exam format and develop a strategy for tackling the exam. 

At the end of the day, the CISSP exam like every other exam out there is about pattern recognition, and doing practice questions will help you train your test-taking natural learning model. So, instead of trying to cover everything and take notes perfectly, focus on doing what is required to achieve your goal. Don't be afraid to change your study approach if it's not working for you.
